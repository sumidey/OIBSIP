        <p class="adjust">Subhash Chandra Bose, also known as Netaji, was one of the most prominent leaders of the
            Indian
            independence movement against British rule. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, he completed
            his education in England and then returned to India to participate in the freedom struggle.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="adjust">Netaji was a charismatic leader who inspired people with his revolutionary ideas and fearless
            attitude.
            He was a man of action and believed in using force against the British. He was known for his military
            tactics and strategies, which he used to great effect in his fight against the British.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="adjust">In 1928, he was elected as the President of the Indian National Congress, but he resigned from
            the post
            after a disagreement with the party's leadership. He formed his own party, the Forward Bloc, to continue
            the struggle for independence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="adjust">Netaji's famous slogan "Give me blood and I will give you freedom" reflects his unwavering
            commitment to
            the cause of Indian independence. He was a man of great vision, and he believed that India needed to be
            free not just from British rule, but also from the shackles of poverty, illiteracy, and social
            inequality.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="adjust">In 1941, Netaji left India and went to Germany, where he sought help from the Nazis in his
            fight against
            the British. He then went to Japan, where he formed the Indian National Army (INA) with the help of the
            Japanese. The INA fought alongside the Japanese against the British in Burma and India.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="adjust">Despite facing many challenges and obstacles, Netaji continued to work towards the goal of a
            free India.
            He believed that the only way to achieve independence was through force, and he was willing to do
            whatever it took to achieve that goal. His contribution to the freedom struggle is immeasurable, and his
            legacy continues to inspire generations of Indians to this day.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="adjust last">On the occasion of his birth anniversary, we pay tribute to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose,
            a true
            hero and
            patriot, who dedicated his life to the service of his country and its people. His life and legacy are an
            inspiration to all of us, and we must strive to uphold the values of freedom, justice, and equality that
            he stood for.
